// The ShapeManager handles the ref-counting on shared shapes:
//
// Each object added to the physics simulation gets a corresponding btRigidBody.
// The body has a btCollisionShape that represents the contours of its collision
// surface.  Multiple bodies may have the same shape.  Rather than create a unique
// btCollisionShape instance for every body with a particular shape we can instead
// use a single shape instance for all of the bodies.  This is called "shape
// sharing".
//
// When body needs a new shape a description of ths shape (ShapeInfo) is assembled
// and a request is sent to the ShapeManager for a corresponding btCollisionShape
// pointer.  The ShapeManager will compute a hash of the ShapeInfo's data and use
// that to find the shape in its map.  If it finds one it increments the ref-count
// and returns the pointer.  If not it asks the ShapeFactory to create it, adds an
// entry in the map with a ref-count of 1, and returns the pointer.
//
// When a body stops using a shape the ShapeManager must be informed so it can
// decrement its ref-count.  When a ref-count drops to zero the ShapeManager
// doesn't delete it right away.  Instead it puts the shape's key on a list delete
// later.  When that list grows big enough the ShapeManager will remove any matching
// entries that still have zero ref-count.
